## Machine Learning for Control Allocation

This work comprise the project thesis from TMR4510 at NTNU, fall 2019. A dataset was created, used for training a neural network using supervised learning in order to learn the physics between the forces/moments acting on ReVolt model ship and the commanded propeller RPMs and angles.
