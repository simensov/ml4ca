realtorquelowlong: 	r-trajectories: bendy wendy
			y-trajectories: great!
			thrust-usage:	low
			thrust-derivs:	low
			angle-derivs:	okay
			note: just seems to be hindered by [0.1, 0.03, 0.03] coeffs - bad sway abilities

oldgaussianlargebatch:	r-trajectories: OK, except NW45 and NW-SW
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	med
			thrust-derivs:	low
			angle-derivs:	okay
			note: seemed to have potential but drifted off twice before regaining pos

actdersmallall:		r-trajectories: like other QP except a bit slow and unstable SW-SE
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	great
			thrust-derivs:  good
			angle-derivs:	okay
			note: 	first RL that fixes NW-SW!! But uses a lot of energy getting there.
			      	also becomes unstable at last transition

acrderallsmallest:	r-trajectories: OK, except NW-SW
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good
			angle-derivs:	good
			note: basically super close, but is bad at moves without heading corrections	

actderros:		r-trajectories: OK, except NW-SW
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good
			angle-derivs:	good
			note: also very close. manages mirrored box test good..... FIGURE OUT

NOTES: The ErrorFramed used the angle error for coordinate rotations instead of NED angle... Fixed, and things are looking GREAT

finalcontanginit:	r-trajectories: PERFECT
			y-trajectories: very good
			thrust-usage:	high
			thrust-derivs:	high
