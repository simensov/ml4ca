realtorquelowlong: 	r-trajectories: bendy wendy
			y-trajectories: great!
			thrust-usage:	low
			thrust-derivs:	low
			angle-derivs:	okay
			note: just seems to be hindered by [0.1, 0.03, 0.03] coeffs - bad sway abilities

actdersmallall:		r-trajectories: like other QP except a bit slow and unstable SW-SE
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	great
			thrust-derivs:  good
			angle-derivs:	okay
			note: 	first RL that fixes NW-SW!! But uses a lot of energy getting there.
			      	also becomes unstable at last transition

acrderallsmallest:	r-trajectories: OK, except NW-SW
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good
			angle-derivs:	good
			note: basically super close, but is bad at moves without heading corrections

			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good
			angle-derivs:	good
			note: also very close. manages mirrored box test good..... FIGURE OUT

NOTES: The ErrorFramed used the angle error for coordinate rotations instead of NED angle... Fixed, and things are looking GREAT

finalcontanginit:	r-trajectories: PERFECT
			y-trajectories: very good
			thrust-usage:	high
			thrust-derivs:	high
			angle-derivs:	great
			note: first test with full angle setup, using cont ang. NICE, but costly

			y-trajectories: okay
			thrust-usage:	high
			thrust-derivs:	okay
			angle-derivs:	locks a bit
			note: first test with full angle setup, using non-cont ang. cont ang seems better


finactderall:		r-trajectories: good
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	high
			thrust-derivs:	high
			angle-derivs:	locks a bit
			note: better than baseline, but still use a lot of thrust

fincontacderall:	r-trajectories: good
			y-trajectories: great
			thrust-usage:	okay
			thrust-derivs:	high
			angle-derivs:	great
			note: getting closer!

finconttorque:		r-trajectories: great, slow
			y-trajectories: great, slow
			thrust-usage:	great
			thrust-derivs:	great
			angle-derivs:	great, locks at 90 deg though
			note: maybe too slow.

NOTES: From now, the cont angles seems like the better choice. The trajectories are better from RL than from QP and pseudo, so now only action penalties is going to be tuned. Torque seems to make studd a bit too slow, and makes the difference between 0 - 100 thrust a lot, but dont care if at 20 instead of 0.

QP fuel: 885 
pseudo:	 1322

finconttotalup:		r-trajectories: cannot be much better
			y-trajectories: very good
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good 
			angle-derivs:	good, does not lock between set points
			fuel: 915 on box test
			note: seems like the most acceptable one in terms of station keeping.

			y-trajectories: very good
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good 
			angle-derivs:	good, does lock

			note: just a really good one

finconttothighbowder:	r-trajectories: very good
			y-trajectories: very good
			thrust-usage:	good
			thrust-derivs:	good 
			angle-derivs:	good, does lock
			fuel: 600 on box test
			note: really pushes fuel to a minimum. Acts as a middle ground of two above wrt. r
